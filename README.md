## This is my personal/professional website, where I try to give you an idea of who I am as a person and a self-taught developer!

I'm also working on a blog for the website! There, I hope to share more details about my coding projects and other things that I do in my daily life - like language learning, visual arts, and gaming. Progress is slow, but I'm trying my best!
